"Hello World"
println(1) // 1
println(1 + 1) // 2
println("Hello!") // Hello!
println("Hello," + " world!") // Hello, world!

// https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/basics.html
// Values
val x = 1 + 1
println(x) // 2

// Values cannot be re-assigned
// x = 3 // This does not compile.

// The type of a value can be omitted and inferred, or it can be explicitly stated:
val x: Int = 1 + 3
println(x) // 4

// Variables
var x = 1 + 1
x = 3 // This compiles because "x" is declared with the "var" keyword.
println(x * x) // 9

// As with values, the type of a variable can be omitted and inferred, or it can be explicitly stated:
var x: Int = 1 + 1

// Blocks
// The result of the last expression in the block is the result of the overall block, too:
println({
  val x = 1 + 1
  x + 1
}) // 3

println({
  val unused = 1 + 1
  val x = 1 + 1
  x + 4
}) // 6

// Functions

// Anonymous function
(x: Int) => x + 1
// On the left of => is a list of parameters. On the right is an expression involving the parameters.

val addOne = (x: Int) => x + 1
println(addOne(846541846)) // 846541847

val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y
println(add(54564649, 2)) // 54564651

// it can have no parameters at all:
val getTheAnswer = () => 42
println(getTheAnswer()) // 42

val getTheText = () => {
  val a = "Hi"
  a
}
println(getTheText()) // Hi

// Methods
// are defined with the def keyword.
// def is followed by a name, parameter list(s), a return type, and a body:
def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
println(add(1, 2)) // 3

def addThenMultiply(x: Int, y: Int)(multiplier: Int): Int = (x + y) * multiplier
println(addThenMultiply(1, 2)(3)) // 9

def name: String = System.getProperty("user.name")
println("Hello, " + name + "!")

// Methods can have multi-line expressions as well:
def getSquareString(input: Double): String = {
  val square = input * input
  square.toString
}
println(getSquareString(2.5)) // 6.25
// The last expression in the body is the methodâ€™s return value.
// (Scala does have a return keyword, but it is rarely used.)

// Classes
// define classes with the class keyword, followed by its name and constructor parameters:

class Greeter(prefix: String, suffix: String) {
  def greet(name: String): Unit =
    println(prefix + name + suffix)
}
// The return type of the method greet is Unit, which signifies that there is nothing meaningful to return.
// It is used similarly to void in Java and C.
// (A difference is that, because every Scala expression must have some value,
// there is actually a singleton value of type Unit, written (). It carries no information.)

// You can make an instance of a class with the new keyword:

val greeter = new Greeter("Hello, ", "!")
greeter.greet("Scala developer") // Hello, Scala developer!

// Case Classes
// By default, instances of case classes are immutable, and they are compared by value
// (unlike classes, whose instances are compared by reference). This makes them additionally useful for pattern matching.

// You can define case classes with the case class keywords:

case class Point(x: Int, y: Int)
// You can instantiate case classes without the new keyword:

val point = Point(1, 2)
val anotherPoint = Point(1, 2)
val yetAnotherPoint = Point(2, 2)
// Instances of case classes are compared by value, not by reference:

if (point == anotherPoint) {
  println(point + " and " + anotherPoint + " are the same.")
} else {
  println(point + " and " + anotherPoint + " are different.")
} // Point(1,2) and Point(1,2) are the same.

if (point == yetAnotherPoint) {
  println(point + " and " + yetAnotherPoint + " are the same.")
} else {
  println(point + " and " + yetAnotherPoint + " are different.")
} // Point(1,2) and Point(2,2) are different.
// There is a lot more to case classes that we would like to introduce,
// and we are convinced you will fall in love with them! We will cover them in depth later.

// Objects
// Objects are single instances of their own definitions. You can think of them as singletons of their own classes.

// You can define objects with the object keyword:

object IdFactory {
  private var counter = 0
  def create(): Int = {
    counter += 1
    counter
  }
}

// You can access an object by referring to its name:

val newId: Int = IdFactory.create()
println(newId) // 1
val newerId: Int = IdFactory.create()
println(newerId) // 2

// Traits
// Traits are ABSTRACT data types containing certain fields and methods.
// In Scala inheritance, a class can only extend one other class, but it can extend multiple traits.

// You can define traits with the trait keyword:

trait Greeter {
  def greet(name: String): Unit
}
// Traits can also have default implementations:

trait Greeter {
  def greet(name: String): Unit =
    println("Hello, " + name + "!")
}
// You can extend traits with the extends keyword and override an implementation with the override keyword:

class DefaultGreeter extends Greeter

class CustomizableGreeter(prefix: String, postfix: String) extends Greeter {
  override def greet(name: String): Unit = {
    println(prefix + name + postfix)
  }
}

val greeter = new DefaultGreeter()
greeter.greet("Scala developer") // Hello, Scala developer!

val customGreeter = new CustomizableGreeter("How are you, ", "?")
customGreeter.greet("Scala developer") // How are you, Scala developer?

// Here, DefaultGreeter extends only one single trait, but it could extend multiple traits.

// Main Method

// The main method is the entry point of a Scala program.
// The Java Virtual Machine requires a main method, named main, that takes one argument: an array of strings.

// Using an object, you can define the main method as follows:

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    println("Hello, Scala developer!")
}
